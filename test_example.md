# Test Document

This is a test documnt with some mispellings.

## Features

- Spellchekcing is important
- We shuold check all files
- Grammer matters too

Here is a code block that should be ignored:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mispeled = "this should not be checked";
    println!("{}", mispeled);
}
```

And some `inline_code_here` that should also be ignored.

But regular text like "recieve" and "occured" should be caught.

The URL https://example.com/somethng should mostly be ignored.
